/**
**  \cfetimecfg Time Server or Time Client Selection

**       packet which is received by time clients.
**
**  \par Limits
**       Enable one, and only one by defining either CFE_PLATFORM_TIME_CFG_SERVER or
**       CFE_PLATFORM_TIME_CFG_CLIENT AS true.  The other must be defined as false.

**
** \par Description:

**      publish time tones with payloads in big-endian order, and time clients
**      will expect the tones to be in big-endian order. This is useful for
**      mixed-endian environments. This will become obsolete once EDS is
**      available and the CFE time tone message is defined.

**       having to track the MET as the count of tone signal interrupts (virtual MET)
**

**       both cannot synchronize to the same tone).
**
**       Note: "disable" this define (set to false) only for Time Servers with local hardware
**       that supports a h/w MET that is synchronized to the tone signal !!!

**       also set to true, then the delta time limits for range checking is used.
**
**       When a new time value is received from an external source, the value is
