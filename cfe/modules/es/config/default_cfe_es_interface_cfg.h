/**
**  \cfeescfg Mission Max Apps in a message
**
**  \par Description:
**      Indicates the maximum number of apps in a telemetry housekeeping message
**
**      This affects the layout of command/telemetry messages but does not affect run
**      time behavior or internal allocation.
**
**  \par Limits
**       All CPUs within the same SB domain (mission) must share the same definition
**       Note this affects the size of messages, so it must not cause any message
**       to exceed the max length.

**       Defines the maximum number of perf ids allowed in command/telemetry messages
**
**      This affects the layout of command/telemetry messages but does not affect run
**      time behavior or internal allocation.
**
**  \par Limits
**       All CPUs within the same SB domain (mission) must share the same definition

/** \cfeescfg Maximum number of block sizes in pool structures
**
**  \par Description:
**      The upper limit for the number of block sizes supported in the generic
**      pool implementation, which in turn implements the memory pools and CDS.
**      This definition is used as the array size with the pool stats structure,
**      and therefore should be consistent across all CPUs in a mission, as well
**      as with the ground station.
**
**      There is also a platform-specific limit which may be fewer than this
**      value.
**
**  \par Limits:
**       Must be at least one.  No specific upper limit, but the number is
**       anticipated to be reasonably small (i.e. tens, not hundreds).  Large
**       values have not been tested.

**      "ApplicationName.CDSName"
**
**      This length does not need to include an extra character for NULL termination.

**  \par Limits
**       This value should be kept as a multiple of 4, to maintain alignment of
**       any possible neighboring fields without implicit padding.

**
**  \par Limits
