/**
**  \cfetblcfg Maximum Table Name Length
**
**  \par Description:
**      Indicates the maximum length (in characters) of the table name
**      ('TblName') portion of a Full Table Name of the following
**      form: "ApplicationName.TblName"
**
**      This length does not need to include an extra character for NULL termination.
**
**  \par Limits
**       This value should be kept as a multiple of 4, to maintain alignment of
**       any possible neighboring fields without implicit padding.

/**
**  \cfetblcfg Maximum Length of Full Table Name in messages
**
**  \par Description:
**      Indicates the maximum length (in characters) of the entire table name
**      within software bus messages, in "AppName.TableName" notation.
**
**      This affects the layout of command/telemetry messages but does not affect run
**      time behavior or internal allocation.
**
**  \par Limits
**       All CPUs within the same SB domain (mission) must share the same definition
**       Note this affects the size of messages, so it must not cause any message
**       to exceed the max length.
**
**       This value should be kept as a multiple of 4, to maintain alignment of
**       any possible neighboring fields without implicit padding.
