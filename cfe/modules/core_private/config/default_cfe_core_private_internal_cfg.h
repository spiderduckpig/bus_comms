/** \cfeescfg CFE core application startup timeout
**
**  \par Description:
**      The upper limit for the amount of time that the cFE core applications
**      (ES, SB, EVS, TIME, TBL) are each allotted to reach their respective
**      "ready" states.
**
**      The CFE "main" thread starts individual tasks for each of the core applications
**      (except FS).  Each of these must perform some initialization work before the
**      next core application can be started, so the main thread waits to ensure that the
**      application has reached the "ready" state before starting the next application.
**
**      If any core application fails to start, then it indicates a major problem with
**      the system and startup is aborted.
**
**      Units are in milliseconds
**
**  \par Limits:
**       Must be defined as an integer value that is greater than
**       or equal to zero.
