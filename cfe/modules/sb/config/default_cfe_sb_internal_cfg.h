/**
**  \cfesbcfg Maximum Number of Unique Message IDs SB Routing Table can hold
**
**  \par Description:
**       Dictates the maximum number of unique MsgIds the SB routing table will hold.
**       This constant has a direct effect on the size of SB's tables and arrays.
**       Keeping this count as low as possible will save memory.
**       To see the run-time, high-water mark and the current utilization figures
**       regarding this parameter, send an SB command to 'Send Statistics Pkt'.
**
**  \par Limits
**       This must be a power of two if software bus message routing hash implementation
**       is being used.  Lower than 64 will cause unit test failures, and
**       telemetry reporting is impacted below 32.  There is no hard
**       upper limit, but impacts memory footprint.  For software bus message routing
**       search implementation the number of msg ids subscribed to impacts performance.

/**
**  \cfesbcfg Highest Valid Message Id
**
**  \par Description:
**       The value of this constant dictates the range of valid message ID's, from 0
**       to CFE_PLATFORM_SB_HIGHEST_VALID_MSGID (inclusive).
**
**       Although this can be defined differently across platforms, each platform can
**       only publish/subscribe to message ids within their allowable range. Typically
**       this value is set the same across all mission platforms to avoid this complexity.
**
**  \par Limits
**       CFE_SB_INVALID_MSG is set to the maximum representable number of type CFE_SB_MsgId_t.
**       CFE_PLATFORM_SB_HIGHEST_VALID_MSGID lower limit is 1, up to CFE_SB_INVALID_MSG_ID - 1.
**
**       When using the direct message map implementation for software bus routing, this
**       value is used to size the map where a value of 0x1FFF results in a 16 KBytes map
**       and 0xFFFF is 128 KBytes.
**
**       When using the hash implementation for software bus routing, a multiple of the
**       CFE_PLATFORM_SB_MAX_MSG_IDS is used to size the message map.  In that case
**       the range selected here does not impact message map memory use, so it's
**       reasonable to use up to the full range supported by the message ID implementation.
