/**
**  \cfesbcfg Maximum SB Message Size
**
**  \par Description:
**      The following definition dictates the maximum message size allowed on
**      the software bus. SB checks the pkt length field in the header of all
**      messages sent. If the pkt length field indicates the message is larger
**      than this define, SB sends an event and rejects the send.
**
**  \par Limits
**      This parameter has a lower limit of 6 (CCSDS primary header size).  There
**      are no restrictions on the upper limit however, the maximum message size is
**      system dependent and should be verified.  Total message size values that are
**      checked against this configuration are defined by a 16 bit data word.

/**
**  \cfesbcfg Maximum Number of pipes that SB command/telemetry messages may hold
**
**  \par Description:
**       Dictates the maximum number of unique Pipes the SB message definitions will hold.
**
**       This affects the layout of command/telemetry messages but does not affect run
**       time behavior or internal allocation.
**
**  \par Limits
**       All CPUs within the same SB domain (mission) must share the same definition
**       Note this affects the size of messages, so it must not cause any message
**       to exceed the max length.
